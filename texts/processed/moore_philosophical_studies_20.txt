that _p_ is true and _q_ false." And I am going, quite arbitrarily to express this relation by writing _p_ * _q_ for "It is not the case that _p_ is true and _q_ false." The relation in question is one which logicians have sometimes expressed by "_p_ implies _q_." It is, for instance, the one which Mr. Russell in the _'Principles of Mathematics_ calls "material implication," and which he and Dr. Whitehead in _Principia Mathematica_ call simply "implication." And if we do use "implication" to stand for this relation, we, of course, got the apparently paradoxical results that every false proposition implies every other proposition, both true and false, and that every true proposition implies every other true proposition: since it is quite clear that if _p_ is false then, whatever _q_ may be, "it is not the case that _p_ is true and _q_ false," and quite clear also, that if _p_ and _q_ are both true, then also "it is not the case that _p_ is true and _q_ false." And these results, it seems to me, appear to be paradoxical, solely because, if we use "implies" in any ordinary sense, they are quite certainly false. Why logicians should have thus chosen to use the word "implies" as a name for a relation, for which it never is used by any one else, I do not know. It is partly, no doubt, because the relation for which they do use it--that expressed by saying "It is not the case that _p_ is true and _q_ false"--is one for which it is very important that they should have a short name, because it is a relation which is very fundamental and about which they need constantly to talk, while (so far as I can discover) it simply has no short name in ordinary life. And it is partly, perhaps, for a reason which leads us back to our present reason for giving some name to this relation. It is, in fact, natural to use "_p_ implies _q_" to mean the same as "If _p,_ then _q."_ And though "If _p_ then _q_" is hardly ever, if ever, used to mean the same as "It is not the case that _p_ is true and _q_ false"; yet the expression "If _anything_ has Q, _it_ has R" may, I think, be naturally used to express the proposition that, in the case of _every_ pair of propositions which resembles the pair A Q and A R in respect of the fact that the first of the pair asserts of some particular thing that it has Q and the second, of the same thing, that it has R, it is not the case that the first is true and the second false. That is to say, if (as I propose to do) we express "It is not the case both that AQ is true and AR false" by AQ * AR, and if, further (on the analogy of the similar case with regard to "entails)," we express the proposition that of _every_ pair of propositions which resemble A Q and A R in the respect just mentioned, it is true that the first has the relation * to the second by _x_Q * _x_R then, it _is_ natural to express _x_Q * _x_R, by "If _anything_ has Q, then _that thing_ has R." And logicians may, I think, have falsely inferred that _since_ it is natural to express "_x_Q * _x_R" by "If _anything_ has Q, then _that thing_ has R," it _must_ be natural to express "AQ * AR" by "If AQ, then AR," and therefore also by "AQ implies AR." If this has been their reason for expressing "_p * q_" by "_p_ implies _q_" then obviously their reason is a fallacy. And, whatever the reason may have been, it seems to me quite certain that "AQ * AR" cannot be properly expressed either by "AQ implies AR" or by "If AQ, then AR," although "_r_Q * _x_R" can be properly expressed by "If anything has Q, then that thing has R." I am going, then, to express the universal proposition, with regard to two particular properties Q and R, which asserts that "Whatever has Q, has R" or "If anything has Q, it has R," without asserting that anything has Q, by _x_Q * _x_R --a means of expressing it, which since we have adopted the convention that "_p_ * _q_" is to mean the same as "It is not the case that _p_ is true and _q_ false," brings out the important fact that this proposition is either identical with or logically equivalent to the proposition that of _every_ such pair of propositions as AQ and AR, it is true that it is not the case that the first is true and the second false. And having adopted this convention, we can now see how, in accordance with it, the proposition, with regard to a particular property P, that P is _internal_ to _everything_ which possesses it, is to be expressed. We saw that P is _internal_ to A is to be expressed by °_xP_° entails (°_x_ = A°) or by the logically equivalent proposition (_x =_ A) entails _xP_ And we have now only to express the proposition that _anything_ that has P, has also the property that P is _internal_ to it. The required expression is obviously as follows. Just as "Anything that has Q, has R" is to be expressed by _x_Q * _x_R so "Anything that has P, has also the property that P is internal to it" will be expressed by _x_P * {°_y_P° entails (°_y x_°)} or by _x_P * {(_v x_) entails _y_P}. We have thus got, in the case of any particular property P, a means of expressing the proposition that it is _internal_ to _every_ term that possesses it, which is both short and brings out clearly the notions that are involved in it. And we do not need, I think, any further special convention for symbolising the proposition that _every_ relational property is internal to any term which possesses it--the proposition, namely, which I called (2) above (pp. 289, 290), and which on p. 287, I called the most important consequence of the dogma of internal relations. We can express it simply enough as follows:-- (2) = "What we assert of P when we say _xP_ * {°_y_P° entails (°_y = x_°)} can be truly asserted of every relational property." And now, for the purpose of comparing (2) with (1), and seeing exactly what is involved in my assertion that (2) does not follow from (1), let us try to express (1) by means of the same conventions. Let us first take the assertion with regard to a particular thing A and a particular relational property P that, from the proposition that A has P it _follows_ that nothing which has not got P is identical with A. This is an assertion which is quite certainly true; since, if anything which had not got P were identical with A, it would follow that °AP°; and from the proposition AP, it certainly _follows_ that °AP° is false, and therefore also that "Something which has not got P is identical with A" is false, or that "Nothing which has not got P is identical with A" is true. And this assertion, in accordance with the conventions we have adopted, will be expressed by AP entails {°_x_P° * (°_x_ = A°)} We want, next, in order to express (1), a means of expressing with regard to a particular relational property P, the assertion that, from the proposition, with regard to _anything_ whatever, that that thing has got P, it _follows_ that nothing which has not got P is identical with the thing in question. This also is an assertion which is quite certainly true; since it merely asserts (what is obviously true) that what AP entails {°_x_P° * (°_x_ = A°)} asserts of A, can be truly asserted of anything whatever. And this assertion, in accordance with the conventions we have adopted, will be expressed by _x_P entails {°_y_P° * (°_y_ = x°)}. The proposition, which I meant to call (1), but which I expressed before rather clumsily, can now be expressed by (1) = "What we assert of P, when we say, _x_P entails {°_y_P° * (°y = _x_°)} can be truly asserted of every relational property." This is a proposition which is again quite certainly true; and, in order to compare it with (2), there is, I think, no need to adopt any further convention for expressing it, since the questions whether it is or is not different from (2), and whether (2) does or does not follow from it, will obviously depend on the same questions with regard to the two propositions, with regard to the particular relational property, P, _x_P entails {°_y_P° * (°_y = x_°)} and _x_P * {_y_P entails (_y = x_)} Now what I maintain with regard to (1) and (2) is that, whereas (1) is true, (2) is false. I maintain, that is to say, that the proposition "What we assert of P, when we say _x_P * {°_y_P° entails (°_y = x_°)}. is true of _every_ relational property" is false, though I admit that what we here assert of P is true of _some_ relational properties. Those of which it is true, I propose to call _internal_ relational properties, those of which it is false _external_ relational properties. The dogma of internal relations, on the other hand, implies that (2) is true; that is to say, that _every_ relational property is _internal_ and that there are no _external_ relational properties. And what I suggest is that the dogma of internal relations has been held only because (2) has been falsely thought to follow from (1). And that (2) does not follow from (1), can, I think, be easily seen as follows. It can follow from (1) only if from any proposition of the form _p_ entails (_q_ * _r_) there follows the corresponding proposition of the form _p_ * (_q_ entails _r_), And that this is not the case can, I think, be easily seen by considering the following three propositions. Let _p_ = "All the books on this shelf are blue," let _q_ = "My copy of the _Principles of Mathematics_ is a book on this shelf," and let _r_ = "My copy of the _Principles of Mathematics_ is blue." Now _p_ here does absolutely _entail_ (_q * r_). That is to say, it absolutely follows from _p_ that "My copy of the _Principles_ is on this shelf," and "My copy of the _Principles_ is _not_ blue," are not, as a matter of fact, both true. But it by no means follows from this that _p_ * (_q_ entails _r_). For what this latter proposition means is "It is not the case both that _p_ is true and that (_q_ entails _r_) is false." And, as a matter of fact, (_q_ entails _r_) is quite certainly false; for from the proposition "My copy of the _Principles_ is on this shelf" the proposition "My copy of the _Principles_ is blue" does _not_ follow. It is simply not the case that the second of these two propositions can be deduced from the first _by itself:_ it is simply not the case that it stands to it in the relation in which it does stand to the conjunctive proposition "All the books on this shelf are blue _and,_ my copy of the _Principles_ is on this shelf." This conjunctive proposition really does _entail_ "My copy of the _Principles_ is blue." But "My copy of the _Principles_ is on this shelf," _by itself_ quite certainly does not entail "My copy of the Principles is blue." It is simply not the case that my copy of the Principles _couldn't_ have been on this shelf without being blue, (_q_ entails _r_) is, therefore, false. And hence "_p_ * (_q_ entails _r_)," can only follow from "_p_ entails (_q_ * _r_)," if from this latter proposition °_p_° follows. But _p_ quite certainly does not follow from this proposition: from the fact that (_q * r_) is deducible from _p_, it does not in the least follow that °_p_° is true. It is, therefore, clearly not the case that every proposition of the form _p_ entails (_q * r_) entails the corresponding proposition of the form _p_ * {_q_ entails _r_}, since we have found one particular proposition of the first form which does _not_ entail the corresponding proposition of the second. To maintain, therefore, that (2) follows from (1) is mere confusion. And one source of the confusion is, I think, pretty plain. (1) does allow you to assert that, if AP is true, then the proposition "°_y_P° * {°(_y_ = A°)}" _must_ be true. What the "must" here expresses is merely that this proposition follows from AP, not that it is in itself a necessary proposition. But it is supposed, through confusion, that what is asserted is that it is not the case both that AP is true and that "°_y_P° * (°_y_ = A°)" is not, _in itself,_ a necessary proposition; that is to say, it is supposed that what is asserted is "AP + {°_y_P° entails (°_y_ = A°)}"; since to say that "°_y_P° * (°_y_ = A°)" is, _in itself_, a necessary proposition is the same thing as to say that "°_y_P° entails (°_y_ = A°)" is also true. In fact it seems to me pretty plain that what is meant by saying of propositions of the form "_x_P * _x_Q" that they are _necessary_ (or "apodeictic") propositions, is merely that the corresponding proposition of the form "_x_P entails _x_Q" is also true, "_x_P _entails_ _x_Q" is not _itself_ a necessary proposition; but, if "_x_P entails _x_Q" is _true,_ then "_x_P * _x_Q" is a necessary proposition--and a necessary truth, since no false propositions are necessary in themselves. Thus what is meant by saying that "Whatever is a right angle, is also an angle" is a necessary truth, is, so far as I can see, simply that the proposition "(_x_ is a right angle) entails (_x_ is an angle)" is also true. This seems to me to give what has, in fact, been generally meant in philosophy by "necessary truths," _e.g._ by Leibniz; and to point out the distinction between them and those true universal propositions which are "mere matters of fact." And if we want to extend the meaning of the name "necessary truth" in such a way that some singular propositions may also be said to be "necessary truths," we can, I think, easily do it as follows. We can say that AP is itself a necessary truth, if and only if the universal proposition "(_x_ = A) * _x_P" (which, as we have seen, follows from AP) is a necessary truth: that is to say, if and only if (_x_ = A) entails _x_P. With this definition, what the dogma of internal relations asserts is that in every case in which a given thing actually has a given relational property, the fact that it has that property is a necessary truth; whereas what I am asserting is that, if the property in question is an "internal" property, then the fact in question will be a necessary truth, whereas if the property in question is "external," then the fact in question will be a mere "matter of fact." So much for the distinction between (1) which is true, and (2), or the dogma of internal relations, which I hold to be false. But I said above, in passing, that my contention that (2) does not follow from (1), involves the rejection of certain views that have sometimes been held as to the meaning of "follows"; and I think it is worth while to say something about this. It is obvious that the possibility of maintaining that (2) does not follow from (1), depends upon its being true that from "_x_P * _x_Q" the proposition "_x_P entails _x_Q" does not follow. And this has sometimes been disputed, and is, I think, often not clearly seen. To begin with, Mr. Russell, in the _Principles of Mathematics_ (p. 34), treats the phrase "_q_ can be deduced from _p_" as if it meant exactly the same thing as "_p * q_" or "_p_ materially implies _q_"; and has repeated the same error elsewhere, _e.g._ in _Philosophical Essays_ (p. 166), where he is discussing what _he_ calls the axiom of internal relations. And I am afraid a good many people have been led to suppose that, since Mr. Russell has said this, it must be true. If it were true, then, of course, it would be impossible to distinguish between (1) and (2), and it would follow that, since (1) certainly is true, what I am calling the dogma of internal relations is true too. But I imagine that Mr. Russell himself would now be willing to admit that, so far from being true, the statement that "_q_ can be deduced from _p_" means the same as "_p_ * _q_" is simply an enormous "howler"; and I do not think I need spend any time in trying to show that it is so. But it may be held that, though "_p_ entails _q_" does not mean the same as "_p * q_," yet nevertheless from "_x_P * _x_Q" the proposition "_x_P entails _x_Q" does follow, for a somewhat more subtle reason; and, if this were so, it would again follow that what I am calling the dogma of internal relations must be true. It may be held, namely, that though "AP entails AQ" does not mean simply "AP * AQ" yet what it does mean is simply the conjunction "AP * AQ _and_ this proposition is an instance of a true formal implication" (the phrase "formal implication" being understood in Mr. Russell's sense, in which "_x_P * _x_Q" asserts a formal implication). This view as to what "AP entails AQ" means, has, for instance, if I understand him rightly, been asserted by Mr. O. Strachey in _Mind,_ N.S., 93. And the same view has been frequently suggested (though I do not know that he has actually asserted it) by Mr. Russell himself (_e.g., Principia Mathematica,_ p. 21). If this view were true, then, though "_x_P entails _x_Q" would not be identical in meaning with "_x_P * _x_Q," yet it would follow from it; since, if _x_P * _x_Q were true, then every particular assertion of the form AP * AQ, would not only be true, but would be an instance of a true formal implication (namely "_x_P * _x_Q") and this, according to the proposed definition, is all that "_x_P entails _x_Q" asserts. If, therefore, it were true, it would again follow that all relational properties must be internal. But that this view also is untrue appears to me perfectly obvious. The proposition that I am in this room does "materially imply" that I am more than five years old, since both are true; and the assertion that it does is also an instance of a true formal implication, since it is in fact true that all the persons in this room are more than five years old; but nothing appears to me more obvious than that the second of these two propositions can _not_ be deduced from the first--that the kind of relation which holds between the premisses and conclusion of a syllogism in _Barbara_ does _not_ hold between them. To put it in another way: it seems to me quite obvious that the properties "being a person in this room" and "being more than five years old" are not related in the kind of way in which "being a right angle" _is_ related to "being an angle," and which we express by saying that, in the case of every term, the proposition that that term is an angle can be deduced from the proposition that it is a right angle. These are the only two suggestions as to the meaning of "_p_ entails _q_" known to me, which, if true, would yield the result that (2) does follow from (1), and that therefore all relational properties are internal; and both of these, it seems to me, are obviously false. All other suggested meanings, so far as I know, would leave it true that (2) does not follow from (1), and therefore that I may possibly be right in maintaining that some relational properties are external. It might, for instance, be suggested that the last proposed definition should be amended as follows--that we should say: "_p_ entails _q_" means "_p * q and_ this proposition is an instance of a formal implication, which is not merely true but _self-evident,_ like the laws of Formal Logic." This proposed definition would avoid the paradoxes involved in Mr. Strachey's definition, since such true formal implications as "all the persons in this room are more than five years old" are certainly not self-evident; and, so far as I. can see, it may state something which is in fact true of _p_ and _q,_ whenever and only when _p_ entails _q._ I do not myself think that it gives the _meaning_ of "_p_ entails _q,_" since the kind of relation which I see to hold between the premisses and conclusion of a syllogism seems to me to be one which is purely "objective" in the sense that no psychological term, such as is involved in the meaning of "self-evident," is involved in its definition (if it has one). I am not, however, concerned to dispute that some such definition of "_p_ entails _q_" as this may be true. Since it is evident that, even if it were, my proposition that "_x_P entails _x_Q" does _not_ follow from "_x_P * _x_Q," would still be true; and hence also my contention that (2) does not follow from (1). So much by way of arguing that we are not bound to hold that all relational properties are internal in the particular sense, with which we are now concerned, in which to say that they are means that in every case in which a thing A has a relational property, it follows from the proposition that a term has _not_ got that property that the term in question is _other_ than A. But I have gone further and asserted that some relational properties certainly are _not_ internal. And in defence of this proposition I do not know that I have anything to say but that it seems to me evident in many cases that a term which _has_ a certain relational property _might_ quite well not have had it: that, for instance, from the mere proposition that this is this, it by no means follows that this has to other things all the relations which it in fact has. Everybody, of course, must admit that if all the propositions which assert of it that it has these properties, do in fact follow from the proposition that this is this, we cannot see that they do. And so far as I can see, there is no reason of any kind for asserting that they do, except the confusion which I have exposed. But it seems to me further that we can see in many cases that the proposition that this has that relation does _not_ follow from the fact that it is this: that, for instance, the proposition that Edward VII was father of George V _is_ a _mere_ matter of fact. I want now to return for a moment to that other meaning of "internal," (p. 286) in which to say that P is internal to A means not merely that anything which had not P would necessarily be _other_ than A, but that it would necessarily be _qualitatively_ different. I said that this was the meaning of "internal" in which the dogma of internal relations holds that all relational properties are "internal"; and that one of the most important consequences which followed from it, was that all relational properties are "internal" in the less extreme sense that we have just been considering. But, if I am not mistaken, there is another important consequence which also follows from it, namely, the Identity of Indiscernibles. For if it be true, in the case of every relational property, that any term which had net that property would necessarily be qualitatively different from any which had, it follows of course that, in the case of two terms one of which has a relational property, which the other has not the two are qualitatively different. But, from the proposition that _x_ is other than _y,_ it _does_ follow that _x_ has some relational property which _y_ has not; and hence, if the dogma of internal relations be true, it will follow that if _x_ is other than _y, x_ is always also qualitatively different from _y,_ which is the principle of Identity of Indiscernibles. This is, of course, a further objection to the dogma of internal relations, since I think it is obvious that the principle of Identity of Indiscernibles is not true. Indeed, so far as I can see, the dogma of internal relations essentially consists in the joint assertion of two indefensible propositions: (1) the proposition that in the case of no relational property is it true of any term which has got that property, that it _might_ not have had it and (2) the Identity of Indiscernibles. I want, finally, to say something about the phrase which Mr. Russell uses in the _Philosophical Essays_ to express the dogma of internal relations. He says it may be expressed in the form "Every relation is grounded in the natures of the related terms" (p. 160). And it can be easily seen, if the account which I have given be true, in what precise sense it does hold this. Mr. Russell is uncertain as to whether by "the nature" of a term is to be understood the term itself or something else. For my part it seems to me that by a term's nature is meant, not the term itself, but what may roughly be called all its qualities as distinguished from its relational properties. But whichever meaning we take, it will follow from what I have said, that the dogma of internal relations does imply that every relational property which a term has is, in a perfectly precise sense, _grounded_ in its nature. It will follow that every such property is _grounded_ in _the term,_ in the sense that, in the case of every such property, it _follows_ from the mere proposition that that term is that term that it has the property in question. And it will also follow that any such property is grounded in the qualities which the term has, in the sense, that if you take _all_ the qualities which the term has, it will again follow in the case of each relational property, from the proposition that the term has _all_ those qualities that it has the relational property in question; since this is implied by the proposition that in the case of any such property, any term which had not had it would necessarily have been different in quality from the term in question. In both of these two senses, then, the dogma of internal relations does, I think, imply that every relational property is grounded in the nature of every term which possesses it; and in this sense that proposition is false. Yet it is worth noting, I think, that there is another sense of "grounded" in which it may quite well be true that every relational property _is_ grounded in the nature of any term which possesses it. Namely that, in the case of every such property, the term in question has some quality _without_ which it could not have had the property. In other words that the relational property _entails_ some quality in the term, though no quality in the term _entails_ the relational property. THE NATURE OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY I should like, if I can, to interest you to-night in one particular question about Moral Philosophy. It is a question which resembles most philosophical questions, in respect of the fact that philosophers are by no means agreed as to what is the right answer to it: some seem to be very strongly convinced that one answer is correct, while others are equally strongly convinced of the opposite. For my own part I do feel some doubt as to which answer is the right one, although, as you will see, I incline rather strongly to one of the two alternatives. I should like very much, if I could, to find some considerations which seemed to me absolutely convincing on the one side or the other; for the question seems to me in itself to be an exceedingly interesting one. I have said that the question is a question _about_ Moral Philosophy; and it seems to me in fact to be a very large and general question which affects the whole of Moral Philosophy. In asking it, we are doing no less than asking what it is that people are doing when they study Moral Philosophy at all: we are asking what sort of questions it is which it is the business of Moral Philosophy to discuss and try to find the right answer to. But I intend, for the sake of simplicity, to confine myself to asking it in two particular instances. Moral Philosophy has, in fact, to discuss a good many different ideas; and though I think this same question may be raised with regard to them all, I intend to pick out two, which seem to me particularly fundamental, and to ask it with regard to them only. My first business must be to explain what these two ideas are. The name Moral Philosophy naturally suggests that
